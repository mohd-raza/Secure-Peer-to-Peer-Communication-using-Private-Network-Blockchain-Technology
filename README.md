# Secure Communication through Blockchain
The research focuses on developing decentralized chat applications that leverage private blockchain networks, particularly using Go-Ethereum (GETH) technology and the clique consensus method, to ensure secure and private peer-to-peer communication while mitigating censorship and privacy risks.

## Motivation
The pursuit of Secure Peer-to-Peer Communication using Private Network Blockchain Technology is underpinned by the escalating threat landscape in the realm of cybersecurity. In recent times, cyberattacks have surged to alarming levels, with an estimated 4,000 attacks occurring daily, resulting in global annual losses exceeding $1 trillion. These attacks come in various forms, from data breaches and ransomware attacks to phishing schemes, posing a significant risk to individuals and organizations alike. The statistics highlight a growing and urgent need to fortify the security of our digital interactions and data.

The COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated the situation by accelerating the shift towards digital communication platforms. This transition has left individuals and organizations more vulnerable to data breaches and cybercrimes. With personal data breaches impacting over 2 billion people worldwide and considering that approximately 60% of small businesses go out of business within six months of a cyberattack, the imperative to enhance the security and privacy of peer-to-peer communication becomes even more pronounced. 

In response to these challenges, the adoption of Private Network Blockchain Technology emerges as a promising solution. It holds the potential to not only mitigate the disconcerting statistics but also to fortify the protection of sensitive information in an increasingly digitalized world.
